Visualization Tool for Electric Vehicle Charge and Range Analysis

This is a data visualization–based project developed during our internship to analyze and understand electric vehicle (EV) performance using interactive dashboards. The system helps visualize key metrics such as battery charge levels, driving range, charging time, and efficiency in a structured and user-friendly format.

The project integrates web technologies with Tableau Software to transform raw EV dataset information into meaningful visual insights for analysis and decision-making.

🔧 Key Features

Interactive EV dashboard for charge and range analysis

Visualization of battery percentage and charging performance

Range and efficiency comparison across different EV models

Responsive user interface built using Bootstrap

Dataset summary tables for EV performance metrics

Embedded Tableau dashboard for interactive analytics

📂 How It Works

EV dataset is collected and prepared for analysis

Data is imported into Tableau to create interactive visualizations

Charts and dashboards are designed to show charge, range, and efficiency patterns

The Tableau dashboard is embedded into a Bootstrap-based web interface

Users can explore visual insights and compare EV performance metrics
